TODO: 
* Line divider between entries?
* smaller hight for sidebar elements? 
* Find a way to insert a caption in the "customize" page of dashboard; right now, I'm using site-description.
* For CODE, PRE, and text block remove padding and make it connect with sidebar.
* Change how sidebar elements are displayed: 
	* make the colors as a border on left only. When hovered, it colors the entire element
