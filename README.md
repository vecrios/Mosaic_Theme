TODO: 
* Line divider between entries?
* smaller hight for sidebar elements? 
* Find a way to insert a caption in the "customize" page of dashboard; right now, I'm using site-description.
* Change how sidebar elements are displayed: 
	* make the colors as a border on left only. When hovered, it colors the entire element
* Add quotation marks around CITE BLOCKQOUTE Q(?)
* Style tables like PRE? 
* Tables? 


BUGS: 
* ABOUT PAGE: bug with sidebar not taking the whole page
* Sample Page: blockqoutes overlap the sidebar (should be fixed with z-index)
	* fixed for now. z-index implemented on li. Do it on whole div?
