TODO: 
* smaller hight for sidebar elements? 
* Change how sidebar elements are displayed: 
	* make the colors as a border on left only. When hovered, it colors the entire element
* Style tables like PRE? 
* Tables? 
* Make main content to the right, sticked to the sidebar
* Comments? 
* Language support? Arabic? 
* Find a way to disable multi-leveling in sidebar contents
* Change headers' fonts to follow titles. 
* Adhere to all standards/conventions for language translation
* Fix sidebar(). Make it either do nothing or remove call from everywhere.
* Remove link from date on article

BUGS: 
* Sample Page: blockqoutes overlap the sidebar (should be fixed with z-index)
	* fixed for now. z-index implemented on li. Do it on whole div? 

IDEAS:
* Search bar under main nav?
* Apply same margins and width to all posts like about page?
